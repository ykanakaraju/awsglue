   Lab 1 - Create table using Amazon Athena Query editor interface
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Open Amazon Athena Console and lauch Query editor

  2. Understand the basics:

	2.1 You are, by default, connected to a Data Source called 'AwsDataCatalog'. This is the 'Glue Catalog'.
            The databases and tables in Athena are integrated with AWS Glue.  

	2.2 Amazon Athena use S3 to store query results. So you have to setup an S3 bucket to store Athena query results.
	    Before you run your first query, you need to set up a query result location in Amazon S3.

  3. Set up a query result location in Amazon S3
	
	3.1  Click on 'Settings' tab and click on 'Manage' button
	3.2  Location of query result: <select an S3 bucket by clicking on Browse button> 


  4. Create a table (and a database) from Amazon S3 bucket as data source.

	4.1 Click on 'Create' button and select 'S3 bucket data'  (left menu)

	4.2 Enter the details (as appropriate in your case):

		Table details
		   Table name: categories
		Database configuration
		   Create a database
		   Database name: retail_db_1
		Dataset
		   Location of input data set: s3://ykr-datasets/retail_db/categories
		Data format
		   Table type: Apache Hive
		   File format: CSV   (this format should match the S3 file format)
		Column details
	           `id` int, `type` int,`name` varchar(100)

	4.3 Preview table query
		-> Observe the table DDL created using HQL syntax. 

	4.4 Click on 'Create table' button

  5. Save the query
	
	When you create a table using the above step your DDL is displayed in a query tab.
	You can save this query for later execution or for reference.

        5.1 Click on the context menu on the query tab (verticle dots icon on the tab)
        5.2 Click on 'Save as' option
	5.3 Provide a name and save the query.

	5.4 You can use this query whenever you want by clicking on 'Saved queries' tab.

  6. Query the catalog table (that you created above)

	6.1 Select the 'retail_db_1' database from the database option (on the left side dropdowns)
	6.2 Run the following query in the query window:
		select * from categories limit 10
