  
  Lab 1: S3 with versioning, storage class, life cycle rules
  ----------------------------------------------------------

	1. Create an S3 bucket from AWS MC (name: ctsdemo)

	2. Enable version control on the buckets
	
		2.1 Select the bucket
		2.2 Properties -> Bucket Versioning -> Edit -> Enable
		
	3. Upload some objects to the bucket with a custom storage class

		3.1 Objects -> Upload -> [ Drag and drop directories & files ]
		3.2 Expand 'Properties' tab -> Select desired storage class
		3.3 Click 'Upload' button to upload.	
		
		Sample S3 URL: https://ctsdemo.s3.amazonaws.com/categories/part-00000
		Sample S3 URI: s3://ctsdemo/categories/part-00000
	
	4. Validate versioning on S3 buckets

		4.1 Check 'Show versions' toggle button. (just beside the search textbox)
		4.2 Upload a copy of the existing file one more time. 
			-> You should now see two versions of the object.
		4.3 Delete the latest version of the object from the bucket	
			-> You should still see the old versions of the object in the S3 bucket.
			
	5. Create Life cycle rules on the S3 bucket to delete previous versions older than 2 days.

		NOTE: To add 'Life cycle rules' on a bucket we should have 'Versioning' enabled.
		
		5.1 S3 bucket ->  Management -> Create Lifecycle Rule.

		5.2 Enter the details:
			  Name: Archive old files
			  Choose a rule scope: Limit the scope of this rule using one or more filters
			  Filter type 
				  Prefix: categories  (this is the directory within the bucket on which we apply rule) 
			  Lifecycle rule actions: Check 'Permanently delete noncurrent versions of objects'
			  Days after objects become noncurrent: 2
			  
		5.3 Click 'Create rule' button to create the rule.
