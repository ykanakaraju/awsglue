  
  Lab 1: S3 Cross Region Replication
  ----------------------------------

	1. Create an S3 bucket from AWS MC (name: ctsdemo)

	2. Enable version control on the buckets
	
		2.1 Select the bucket
		2.2 Properties -> Bucket Versioning -> Edit -> Enable
		
	3. Upload some objects to the bucket

		3.1 Objects -> Upload -> [ Drag and drop directories & files ]
		3.2 Click 'Upload' button to upload.	
		
	4. Enable "S3 Cross-Region Replication" for fault tolerance

		By enabling 'Cross-Region Replication' we can have a copy of the s3 bucket 
		or objects within the bucket in some other Region.

		4.1 Create an additional bucket in a different region (ctsdemo-copy in us-east-2 region)
		4.2 Create a role by the name S3FullAccessRole with AmazonS3FullAccess policy.
		4.3 Go to the bucket (ctsdemo in my case).
		4.4 Click on Management and go to Replication rules.
		4.5 Click on Create replication rule and enter details:

			  * Replication rule name: ctsdemo replication
			  * Status: Enabled
			  * Choose a Rule Scope: Apply to all objects in the bucket
			  * Destination: Choose a bucket in this account
			  * Bucket name: ctsdemo-copy

			  NOTE: Make sure to enable versioning on the destination bucket.
			  Destination storage class: <You can specify the storage class for replicated objects>

	5. Now add a few new objects in the source S3 bucket. Those objects will be replicated in the destination bucket
		
		NOTE: The replication takes little time (few minutes some times)
