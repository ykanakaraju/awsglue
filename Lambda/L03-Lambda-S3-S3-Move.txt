  ------------------------------------------------------------------

	*** Script: cts-lambda-s3-s3-move.py ***

	1. Create a new IAM Role (or update an existing role) as follows:
		
		Name: CTSLambdaDemoRole
		Service: lambda
		Policies: CloudWatchFullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess				

	2. Open Amazon S3 management console and create two buckets as source and target bucket:
		
		* ctsdemo-input-data   (used as source bucket)
		* ctsdemo-output-data   (used as target bucket)

	3. Open a separate AWS Lambda console window and click on 'Create new function' button

	4. Enter following details:
		
		* Author from scratch
		* Function name: cts-lambda-s3-s3-move
		* Runtime: Python 3.9
		* Architecture: x86_64
		* Permissions: Click on 'Change default execution role' link
			Select 'Use an existing role' option 
			Select role created in step 1
		* Advanced settings : leave defaults

	5. Click on 'Create function' button after enter all the above details

	6. In the function details page, click on the 'Code' tab 

	7. Put the code from the "cts-lambda-s3-s3-move.py" script and click on 'Deploy' button.
	   NOTE: make sure you put correct 'target_bucket' in the python code.

	8. Lets add source S3 bucket as a trigger for the lambda function. Do the following:
		
		* Click on 'Add trigger' button in the 'Function overview' section. 
		* Select a source: select 'S3' as the source from the dropdown
		* Bucket: Select your source bucket (i.e s3/ctsdemo-input-data in this case)
		* Event type: All object creation events
		* Recursive invocation: Check
		* Click on 'Add' button

	9. Now, upload some files to the source bucket.
	
		* Every file will invoke a separate Lambda function execution.
		* The function moves the file to the destination bucket and deletes the files from the source bucket.
