 Lab 2: Creating and running a Glue trigger to invoke a Glue job
==================================================================

 *** NOTE: This is a continuation of Lab 1 ***

 => A trigger is used to manage and schedule an ETL job execution

 In this demo, we do the following:

   -> Create a Trigger to invoke the Glue job
   -> Start the trigger to run the job
   -> Validate results using Athena

   Source Data (Public S3 Bucket):  s3://crawler-public-us-east-1/flight/2016/csv



 Add a Trigger to invoke and run the Glue Job
 -----------------------------------------------

 1. Delete the 'parquet' folder in your S3 bucket 'cts-flights'

 2. Create a Trigger  (trigger schedules a Glue job to run on-demand or as per a schedule)

	2.1 Open Glue console and Click on the 'Triggers' menu option under 'Data integration and ETL' section

	2.2 Click on 'Add trigger' button
		Name: flights_csv_to_parquet_trigger
		Trigger type: On-demand
		-> Next

	2.3 Choose jobs or crawlers to activate
		Click on 'Add a target resource' button
		Select 'job' as resource type and select 'flights_csv_to_parquet' job
		Job bookmark : disabled
		-> Next -> Finish

	2.4 Start the trigger	
		Select the trigger and click on 'Start trigger' option from 'Actions' menu button
		Wait for the trigger to complete running the job

	2.5 Make sure the 'parquet' folder is recreated in the S3 bucket

 3. Validate the data in the 'parquet' S3 bucket using Athena
	** Follow the steps from Lab-2 **
	Query: select count(1) from flights_csv;
