   Lab 5: ETL PySpark job with Joins
 ========================================================

   1. Load the required data to S3
	1.1 Create the following S3 directory structure  (with your own bucket names, ofcourse)
		s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/movies/             
		s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/ratings/
		s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/joined_output/

	1.2 Load the following datasets to the corresponding buckets:
		movies.csv to s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/movies/
		ratings.csv to s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/ratings/

   2. Create an IAM Role (CTSGlueRole) for Glue with the following policies:			
	Service: Glue
	Policies:   
	  -> AmazonS3FullAccess
	  -> AWSGlueServiceRole

   3. Create a database with the name 'glue_joins'

   4. Create two different crawlers to crawl the 'movies' and 'ratings' S3 buckets
      and run them. Use 'glue_joins' as database. (do not give any table prefixes)

	  -> After this step you should have 'movies' and ratings' tables created in Glue catalog

   5. Validate the data of 'movies' and 'ratings' using Athena. 
	

   6. Create the Glue job

	Create job
		Type: Spark script editor
		Options: 
			Upload and edit an existing script
			-> Browse and select the provide script file (moviesratings-join.py)

			** NOTE: make sure the following lines are modified **
			------------------------------------------------------
			glue_db = "glue_joins"
			glue_movies = "movies"
			glue_ratings = "ratings"

			s3_write_path = "s3://iquiz.glue/movie_ratings/joined_output/"
			----------------------------------------------------------------------

		Click on 'Create' button

	Click on 'Job details' tab
		Name: PySpark Joins Demo

   7. Run the job
	Wait until job is completed. 

   8. Check the results
